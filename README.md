This was a project for John Dalbey's CPE 305.  A lot of the code is shit due to
time constraints and unfamiliarity with Swing.

If you are a computing student at Cal Poly who has not yet taken CPE 305, do
not read this.

If you are a non-computing student at Cal Poly who might transfer to a
computing major, do not read this.

If you are a student at another school who might transfer to Cal Poly, do not
read this.

If you are a potential student of Cal Poly, do not read this.
